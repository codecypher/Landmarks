/*
  HikeBadge.swift

  A view that shows a badge for hiking.
 
  This view composes the Badge from Drawing Paths and Shapes along with some descriptive text about the hike.
 
  The badge is just a graphic, so the text in HikeBadge along with the accessibility(label:) modifier
  makes the meaning of the badge clearer to other users.
  
  The two different uses of the frame(width:height:) modifier configure the badge to render at a scaled form
  of its design-time dimensions of 300 Ã— 300 points.
